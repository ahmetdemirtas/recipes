TOTAL TIME: 0:15

In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, brown sugar, and salt. 
In a separate bowl, whisk together milk and sour cream, then add eggs one at a time. Stir in vanilla. 
Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and stir with a wooden spoon until just combined.  
Melt butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. When the butter is foamy, reduce heat to medium-low and ladle pancake batter into skillet. Top each with a few banana coins. Cook until bubbles start to form in batter and the pancake is golden underneath, about 3 minutes then flip and cook the other side until golden, another 3 minutes.  Repeat with remaining batter.
